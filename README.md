# Bun.js and htmx Learning Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to learning and experimenting with [Bun.js](https://bunjs.org/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/). 

## About

This repository serves as my personal playground for exploring the capabilities of Bun.js, a modern JavaScript runtime, and htmx, a framework for creating web applications with high-performance HTML responses. I'm using this space to experiment, create sample projects, and document my learning journey as I dive into these exciting technologies.

## Why Bun.js and htmx?

- **Bun.js:** Bun.js is gaining popularity for its speed and efficiency in building web applications. I'm here to discover its features, understand its ecosystem, and harness its power in my projects.

- **htmx:** htmx simplifies front-end development by enabling dynamic HTML updates without writing excessive JavaScript. I'm excited to explore how htmx can enhance user interactions and improve web app performance.

## Projects

Throughout my learning journey, I'll be working on various projects and examples to showcase the capabilities of Bun.js and htmx. You can find these projects in the repository's [Projects](./projects) directory.
